# Political Bot

### A repo for my CS40 reddit bot along with the subreddit I created

![A screenshot of the subreddit](subreddit.png)

#### A note before I go into my bot:

1. I'm somewhat proud of the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/csci040temp/) that I created in desperate times
2. The subreddit has a shameless plug for Mike Izbicki's website, and I made it look pretty (cause I enjoy front-end development)
3. That's it. Just wanted to boast about the subreddit for maybe 5 extra credit points *wink wink*

#### Things to know about my bot:

* My bot is intended to be used for CS40, and graded by Mike Izbicki
* The bot is *intended* to support Donald Trump, but also has an option of trashing both candidates
* If edited slightly, the bot will upvote or downvote comments or submissions based on the **textblob** library
* The comment_counter.py file was included to test how many valid comments I had in the subreddit/post

#### An example of what the bot does:

![A screenshot of something I liked that the bot did](botexample.png)

As you can see, the bot created a comment that trashed both candidates, which I thought was hilarious and shows that the bot can look human as well!

#### Valid Comments

```
len(comments)= 1000
len(top_level_comments)= 12
len(replies)= 988
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 5
len(not_self_replies)= 988
len(valid_replies)= 589
========================================
valid_comments= 594
========================================
```

Process finished with exit code 0

#### What I believe my score *should* be:

* One thing I noted in the file was that I completed some extra credit, but did not include it purposefully
* This is because some of the extra credit can be placed in some blocks of code while others in different blocks
* I want the code reviewer (Mike, in this case) to be able to look at the code to check off marks as chronologically and not get messed up scoring extra credit randomly.
* If you would like me to put the extra credit in the code, just let me know, but as of this moment, they are just listed after all of the tasks

**I believe my score should be: **23 points**.**

*However*, if you could award some extra credit points for creating and styling the reddit page with a plug to your website, it would be heavily appreciated...
